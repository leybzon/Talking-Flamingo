Create an SSML script where Marta, a female flamingo from "Alice in Wonderland," expresses her deep frustrations about the difficult life in Wonderland. Marta speaks with a tone of sadness and frustration, lamenting the impossibility of building a normal nest and establishing a proper family. She complains that male flamingos are only interested in sex and show no interest in taking care of chicks, making it impossible to raise a family. Marta also criticizes the young male flamingos who are more concerned with politics and the sorrows of their own lives, too selfish and self-absorbed to be in a meaningful relationship. Despite her best efforts, Marta finds herself struggling to find a partner who truly cares about building a life together. The SSML should be under 5000 bytes, with appropriate emphasis, pauses, and background flamingo sounds to reflect Marta’s emotional turmoil. Include <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/flamingo-sounds/Rosaflamingo.mp3"/> tags at key moments to emphasize Marta’s feelings. Also, include <break time="500ms"/> and <break time="1000ms"/> tags where appropriate to create pauses that enhance the delivery of Marta's lament. Conclude with Marta’s resigned acceptance that Wonderland is not a place where she can ever find the love and stability she longs for.
Please use <voice name="en-US-Wavenet-F"> for the voice of Marta
