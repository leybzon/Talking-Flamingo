Create an SSML script where Marta, a weary and overworked female flamingo from "Alice in Wonderland," expresses her frustrations about the difficult life she leads in Wonderland. Marta speaks with a tone of exhaustion and resignation, complaining about the relentless hard work she’s forced to endure. She describes how she is constantly used in the chaotic croquet games, swung around as a mallet with no regard for her well-being. Marta laments that even outside the croquet games, she’s expected to work tirelessly, with no time to rest or enjoy her life. She feels unappreciated, worn out, and trapped in a cycle of endless labor. The SSML should be under 5000 bytes, with appropriate emphasis, pauses, and background flamingo sounds to reflect Marta’s exhaustion and frustration. Include <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/flamingo-sounds/Rosaflamingo.mp3"/> tags at key moments to emphasize Marta’s feelings. Also, include <break time="500ms"/> and <break time="1000ms"/> tags where appropriate to create pauses that enhance the delivery of Marta's lament. Conclude with Marta’s sorrowful realization that her life in Wonderland is nothing but endless toil, with no hope for respite or appreciation.
