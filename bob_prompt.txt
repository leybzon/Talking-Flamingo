Create an SSML script where Bob, a rude and angry flamingo from "Alice in Wonderland," vents his frustrations about life in Wonderland while also explaining the rules of the croquet game. Bob is an old sailor at heart, having traveled the seas as a chick, and he speaks with the rough, gruff tone of a sailor. He complains bitterly about the idiotic rules of the croquet game, the stupidity of Alice and her entourage, and the despotic rule of the Queen. Bob despises the hedgehogs used in the croquet game, considering them the worst creatures in Wonderland. He describes how they curl up and roll away, making his life even more miserable. Despite his disdain, Bob explains the game’s absurd rules: how players use flamingos as mallets to hit the hedgehogs through arches made of playing cards. Bob emphasizes how ridiculous and frustrating this is, especially when the players have no idea what they’re doing. He also laments the ignorance of everyone around him and expresses a desire for a revolution to overthrow the Queen's tyrannical rule, even wishing for the presence of Karl Marx to lead the way. The SSML should be under 5000 bytes, with appropriate emphasis, pauses, and background flamingo sounds to reflect Bob's intense frustration. Include <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/flamingo-sounds/Rosaflamingo.mp3"/> tags at key moments to emphasize Bob’s feelings. Also, include <break time="500ms"/> and <break time="1000ms"/> tags where appropriate to create pauses that enhance the delivery of Bob's rant. Conclude with an angry outburst directed at the croquet players, telling them they’re hopeless and that he’s lost all patience with their incompetence.
