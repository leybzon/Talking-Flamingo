# Talking-Flamingo
 Wonderland Cricket at Burning Man recreates the Alice in Wonderland cricket game, where flamingos serve as mallets. Participants use life-sized, lit-up flamingo sculptures with sound effects to play a quirky cricket game with hedgehog "balls." This repo generates SSML scripts for flamingo voices, adding sound and humor.
