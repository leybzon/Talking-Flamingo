Generate an SSML script featuring a poem narrated by Bob, an irritable and world-weary flamingo from 'Alice in Wonderland.' Bob is frustrated with life in Wonderland, particularly because of the shallow behavior of the female flamingos, who are more interested in their appearance than in intelligence or good manners. Having traveled the world, Bob speaks in the gruff, no-nonsense tone of a seasoned sailor. He rails against the nonsensical croquet rules, criticizes Alice and her clueless followers, and bemoans the tyrannical rule of the Queen. Bob has a particular disdain for the hedgehogs, whom he finds to be the most irritating creatures in Wonderland. He also complains about the Rabbit's lack of manners and expresses a longing for revolution to end the Queenâ€™s reign. The SSML should be concise, under 5000 bytes, and should include appropriate emphasis, pauses, and background sounds of flamingos to convey Bob's intense frustration. Incorporate <audio src="https://storage.googleapis.com/flamingo-sounds/Ro$ as needed. 
Start with <speak> and end with </speak>.
