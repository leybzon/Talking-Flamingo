Craft an SSML script where Marta, a fatigued and disillusioned female flamingo from 'Alice in Wonderland,' pours out her heart about the burdensome life she endures in Wonderland. Marta speaks in a voice filled with weariness and a sense of hopelessness, detailing the endless labor she's subjected to. She vividly recounts how she's constantly used as a mallet in the chaotic croquet games, swung about with no concern for her comfort or well-being. Outside of the games, her life is no less grueling, as she’s expected to work without pause, leaving her no time to relax or savor any joy. Marta feels utterly unappreciated, completely worn down, and trapped in a cycle of ceaseless toil. The SSML should be concise, under 5000 bytes, and should incorporate appropriate emphasis, pauses, and background flamingo sounds to underscore Marta's deep exhaustion and frustration. Include <audio src='https://storage.googleapis.com/flamingo-sounds/Rosaflamingo.mp3'/> at key emotional points to highlight her feelings. Use <break time='500ms'/> and <break time='1000ms'/> strategically to create pauses that accentuate Marta's sorrowful reflections. End with Marta’s poignant realization that her existence in Wonderland is nothing more than an unending cycle of labor, with no hope for rest or recognition
